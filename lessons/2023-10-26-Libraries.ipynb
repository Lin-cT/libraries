    "<strong><font size = 26>What are Libraries?</font></strong><br><br>\n",
    "In Python, a library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and modules that extend the language's capabilities. These libraries are designed to be reused by developers to perform common tasks, rather than having to write the code from scratch. Libraries are essential for simplifying and accelerating the development process, as they provide a wide range of tools and functions for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modules: Libraries in Python consist of modules, which are individual Python files containing functions, classes, and variables related to a specific set of tasks or a particular domain. You can import these modules into your own Python code to access their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as working with files, networking, data processing, and more. These modules are readily available and do not require installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Third-party Libraries: In addition to the standard library, there is a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries created by the Python community. These libraries cover a wide range of domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, game development, and more. Some popular third-party libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Django, Flask, and many others."
