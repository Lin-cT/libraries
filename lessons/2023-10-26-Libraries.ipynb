    "<strong><font size = 26>What are Libraries?</font></strong><br><br>\n",
    "In Python, a library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and modules that extend the language's capabilities. These libraries are designed to be reused by developers to perform common tasks, rather than having to write the code from scratch. Libraries are essential for simplifying and accelerating the development process, as they provide a wide range of tools and functions for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modules: Libraries in Python consist of modules, which are individual Python files containing functions, classes, and variables related to a specific set of tasks or a particular domain. You can import these modules into your own Python code to access their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as working with files, networking, data processing, and more. These modules are readily available and do not require installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Third-party Libraries: In addition to the standard library, there is a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries created by the Python community. These libraries cover a wide range of domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, game development, and more. Some popular third-party libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Django, Flask, and many others."

    "The provided code demonstrates a basic example of linear regression using TensorFlow and Keras. It begins by importing the necessary libraries, TensorFlow and NumPy. It then generates a synthetic dataset with 1000 samples, where the input features are random, and the target values are computed as a linear combination of the input features with added noise. A data pipeline is set up using TensorFlow, which includes shuffling and batching the data for efficient processing. A simple linear regression model is defined using Keras, consisting of one dense layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function. It is then trained on the synthetic data for ten epochs. After training, the model is used to make predictions on new data points, and the predictions are printed to the console. This code provides a basic illustration of how to perform a simple machine learning task with TensorFlow, from data generation to model training and prediction."
